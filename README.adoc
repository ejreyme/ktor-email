= Ktor Email Service
A robust, scalable email queueing and delivery service built with Ktor. This service provides reliable email delivery with configurable queuing mechanisms, retry logic, and monitoring capabilities.

== Features
- **Multiple Queueing Backends**:
* In-memory queue (default)
* Redis-backed queue
* Support for future implementations (RabbitMQ, Database)

- **Reliable Email Delivery**:
* Configurable retry mechanism with exponential backoff
* Detailed email processing history
* Error tracking and reporting

- **Performance Monitoring**:
* Queue status metrics
* Processing history
* Processing time tracking

- **RESTful API**:
* Email submission endpoint
* Queue status monitoring
* Email history retrieval

- **Scalability**:
* Configurable worker count
* Priority-based email processing
* Delayed email delivery support

== Configuration
The service can be configured through your file: `application.conf`

[source,hocon]
----
email {
    from = "your-email@example.com"
    password = "your-password"
    host = "smtp.example.com"
    port = 587

    queue {
        type = "IN_MEMORY" # Options: IN_MEMORY, REDIS, RABBIT_MQ, DATABASE
    }
}

# Required only if using Redis queue
redis {
    host = "localhost"
    port = 6379
}

== Queue Types
=== In-Memory Queue
Perfect for single-instance deployments or testing environments. All queued emails are stored in memory and lost if the application restarts.

=== Redis Queue

Recommended for production environments. Provides:
- Persistence across application restarts
- Distributed queue support for multi-instance deployments
- Scalable email processing

=== Future Queue Types
The architecture supports implementing additional queue backends:

- RabbitMQ (planned)
- Database-backed queue (planned)

== Architecture

The service consists of the following main components:

1. : Core email sending functionality using JavaMail **KtorEmailService**
2. : Interface for different queue implementations **EmailQueueService**
3. : Factory for creating different queue implementations **EmailQueueFactory**
4. **RESTful API**: Endpoints for email submission and monitoring
5. **Monitoring**: Metrics and history tracking

== Worker Model

The service uses a configurable number of workers to process emails in parallel:

[source,kotlin]
----
emailQueueService.startProcessing(3) // Start with 3 workers
----
Each worker:

- Pulls emails from the queue
- Attempts delivery
- Handles failures with exponential backoff
- Updates metrics and history

== Error Handling

The service implements robust error handling:

- Failed emails are requeued with exponential backoff
- Maximum of 3 retry attempts before marking as failed
- Detailed error messages are stored in the processing history

== Metrics
The service tracks the following metrics:

- Queue size
- Total emails queued
- Total emails processed
- Total emails failed
- Processing status (active/inactive)

== Requirements

- Java 17+
- Kotlin 2.1+
- Ktor server
- For Redis queue: Redis server
- SMTP server for email delivery
